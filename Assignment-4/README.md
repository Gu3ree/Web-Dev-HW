**Alt text** can be used as an attribute inserted into at HTML doc to tell the web viewers the content of an image. It can be a description of a picture or other element.

**Forms** can be found on any website we go to. On Youtube for instance. If the viewer sees a video on the page that doesn't display the full title because it is too long, the viewer can move the mouse over the video and wait for the alt text to appear to give more detail.

**Work Cycle**
It was very tricky getting everything in the correct HTML texts and especially challenging getting the alt text to work. This did take me some time, and it was difficult but I did learn a lot. For some reason I have one image and I do not know why it won't display, so I have yet to work it out.
