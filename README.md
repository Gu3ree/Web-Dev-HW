# My First README.md
## Guthrie McLean

I decided to take this class because I love Media Arts, and I am fascinated by web technology and want to learn more.

But what is the internet? I was really amazed to learn that:

- No one controls the internet.
- On October 29, 1969, the first message was sent to the internet saying "lo" - before the system crashed itself.
- The internet is simply a wire buried in the ground. A server is a special computer. When sending an email, every sever has an IP address, and helps other computers find each other.
