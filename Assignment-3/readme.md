# Assignment 3 Summary
## Guthrie McLean

Each page can have multiple "body" and "head"s elements within a page. The <head> element contains head elements. It can be the title for a webpage, scripts, styles and meta information. The <body> element is where information is stored that displays content by the user. There are two types of markup: Structural and semantic. These makes websites more accessible.

***Structural markup*** embeds information about the structure of a file and how the document will be read and outlined. This includes headings, breaks, paragraphs and lists.
***Semantic markup*** is helpful because it can emphasize words e.g. bold, italics or quotes.

The work cycle was interesting and challenging. It was easier this time around, but I still had some trouble getting the beet cake image to appear on the website.
