    1. The Ainu people were first known to the Japans in the Jomon period, the Ainu people inhabited vast territories which are
    made up of parts modern day Eastern Russia, Mongolia, China and Korea . Not unlike their indigenous
    counterparts in the Americans, they were increasingly squeezed into smaller and smaller regions by the
    groups that would come to dominate them, and their land. These groups held themselves up as morally
    and culturally superior.

    Unlike the Ainu and the indigenous tribes of the Northwest Territories, these
    immigrants saw themselves as conquers of nature, rather than as constituent parts of nature. Conflict was
    inevitable.

    2. Like their North American counterparts the Ainu of Hokkaido were diversified. They spoke various dialects of the
    Ainu language some of which are/were mutually unintelligible. Some were mountain people, others made their
    living by the seas, while others took sustenance from the forests and plains. Most Ainu, at the time the cattle and
    timber industries determined to take their lands, were hunters, gardeners, and fishers.

    3. Cultural similarities such as an immense reverence for the brown bear, are shared by both the Crow,
    Hidatsa, Lillioet and other Native American tribes and the Ainu. Other similarities can be seen in textiles
    and use of salmon for boots.

    4. Taking their cue from the west, the Japanese did their best to force assimilation, nearly wiping out the Ainu
    language, forcibly removing them from the most favored land, and exposing them to diseases to which they had no antibodies.
  </p>
    “In 1899, the Hokkaido Former Aborigines Protection Act came into force to finalize the assimilation of
    the Ainu into Japanese society” This Act designated the Ainu as Japanese, and allowed the government to
    appropriate their lands, and denied the Ainu the right to speak their native languages. Landless and illiterate in
    Japanese, the Ainu sank into abject poverty and were subjected to untoward discrimination.
    5. Today Japan has recognized the value of the Ainu culture, issued a public apology for the atrocities committed
    against them and is taking steps to preserve their history and language. However, the motives may be mixed as
    tourism is a major focus of post-industrial Japan’s economic plans. This approach to lift the Ainu out of poverty
    risks caricaturizing their way of life and their people largely for the profit of others. Litigation brought by the Ainu
    against the Japanese Government is still pending.
    Conclusion
    What this course has shown me is that the conflict is about what has been named modernity. It is not
    local, nor is it particular to any region or race. For cultures that perceive themselves as superior to nature,
    the concept of the trek to modernity is linear—a straight ascending line toward perfection. Those cultures
    who embraced the concept of being masters of the environment, exploiters of the riches of the earth,
    naturally pursued technology development with great enthusiasm and reaped the short-term benefits and
    the surpluses technological advances beget. Hence, they were able to reinforce their self-concept as
    culturally superior, dominant those cultures with differing ideals and priorities, and justify the notion of
    empire.
    At this juncture in human development, we are seeing a lot of the negative effects resulting from
    embracing such ideals. Many people, see themselves as promoting new ways of viewing the earth and its
    inhabitants—but these ideas are-not-new, they have always existed, even, long ago, among Europeans and
    others who would become colonials.
    Here, in examining the similarities in the trajectories of the Ainu and Native peoples of Montana, it is
    clear to see that despite all the atrocities and discrimination, their cultures and ways of life have survived,
    just barely, but for thousands of years, while modernity is just a few hundred years old and is rapidly
    undoing itself. Maybe the reason for the survival of these cultures is because their way has something
    substantive to offer humanity. Without romanticizing, consider how many aspects of modernity have
    already become archaic and useless, destructive and /or toxic. I am not suggesting that these cultures that
    have embraced the concept of modernity as linear have nothing to contribute, but it feels today to be
    largely out of balance, it lacks continuity, and masks simplicity, and I think we should open our minds to
    the possibility of broadening our concept of human development and our place in in the natural world.

   Undated.
