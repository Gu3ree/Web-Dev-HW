I'm sure as most people will probably note this was no easy task. It was the hardest out of all assignments. I learned how to navigate the boxes which was great, but placing them in the correct position was extremely difficult and took up too much of my time, and as you can tell, I am not finished. This is still a work in progress, but for now, I am submitting it as I am running out of time. But I hope my extra credit assignment will make up for it.
