I like all kinds of music from the 60's, 70's and 90's. Maybe not the 80's as much. I felt purple (or red), blue and green were suitable for the 60's or the 70's but I chose the 70's. The one band I thought of in particular were the Beatles even though they pretty much ended their band by 1970. But their album covers consisted of a lot of "Hippie colors" if you will (except for the White Album), which featured a lot of blue, green, purple and red. I don't think the 70's were too far apart from the 60's in terms of coloring. Both the 60's and 70's music makes me think of those colors. My favorite artists from this period were Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Rolling Stones to name a few.
There was an excessive amount of HTML coding needed for this website that messed with my head, but I think I covered most of the material.
