*Assignment-5 Summary*

**The Attributes**

The div elements are a set of block-level elements that group other elements together, much like a set of legos, that create the structure of a webpage. The class attribute groups types of elements that are similar content or have a similar function. It identifies and selects value for HTML elements. Ex: class="long-block" or class="short-block".
The <span> element is used to group together the inline-elements in a document. This tag can have multiple span elements within a div.
The "id" (or Global) attribute is defined as a unique id that identifies specific elements e.g. id="long-blue" or id="short-blue".

**Third-party over Self-hosted Media**

Self-hosted media often charges a person extra if they use a significant amount of bandwidth. Third-party options can provide more affordable solutions. With Third-party hosting, people can upload higher quality versions of media and it will be compatible with a variety of web browsers.

**My Work Cycle**

I had some confusion as usual but looked at other students work which helped and I did some reviewing on the previous modules. I had fun learning about the div elements and I now have a clearer understanding of how websites are structured and organized. Choosing a favorite song was difficult, but ultimately I had to make a decision. Some of my favorite songs do not have a music video. Paul McCartney's "Mr. Bellamy" (2007) for instance does not. In researching the song I chose,"Hurt", I was surprised to find out that the song was not originally performed by Cash, but it was actually written and performed by Trent Reznor.
