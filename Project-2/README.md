Web designing and HTML coding has been fun and interesting to me. This project however was quite a task and probably the hardest one I've worked on. This project took me several hours to finish. The result was fun to see. For this project, I prepared my favorite meal "Peanut Butter Chicken" which my mother taught me when I was a kid, and I used my own pictures that I took for posting on the website. I admit my recipe was missing one ingredient from the website (chilli peppers) because the grocery store did not have it. Since I did not have that included in my photos, I chose not to include it on my recipe website, otherwise I would highly recommend adding chilli peppers.

Adding things like tables, heads and titles weren't new to me. What I found particularly difficult was adding alt, width, height with my images and making sure everything was the right size. Sometimes I would forget to use quotation marks for inserting my images and they wouldn't appear. I added spaces on my tables this time to help keep track of everything and make it easier to navigate. That being said, this was no simple task.
I don't know too much about CSS but I am excited to learn. I'm ready to move away from basic HTML.
