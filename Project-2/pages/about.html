      Hello everyone. My name is Guthrie or 高思睿 (gaosirui). I am a US citizen but grew up more than half of my life in China and
      consider myself an international citizen. I am bilingual and speak English and Mandarin Chinese.
      I am a senior at the University of Montana studying East Asian Studies with a Chinese and Media Arts minor.
      I have always been passionate about art since I was a child. I took Intro to Web Design because it was part
      of a requirement I needed to complete my Media Arts minor, but also because I was interested. I decided to make a recipe
      website based on my favorite meal originally made by my mother. I wanted to do this just because I would really like people
      to try it and I am very proud of this family recipe. My dream however, is not to become a chef, but a filmmaker. I love art
      and movies and plan on studying film one day. Below is a short animation project I did my second semester at UMT for Intro
      to Photoshop. Have a look!
